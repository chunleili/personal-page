# Summary

I'm a PhD candidate at the VR Lab of Beihang University from 2021, supervised by Prof. Qinping Zhao. My research focuses on computer graphics simulation. Currently I am a visiting student at University College London, supervised by Prof. He Wang. I am about to graduate in 2026. I am now working on the project of accelearting the solution of PDE with neural operator.
